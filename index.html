              <p>
                [Verse 1] <br />
                I'm from South Philadelphia <br />
                I'm from Avenue C <br />
                I've seen empty hands that was waiting to freeze <br />
                I'm from the Bowery, too! <br />
                <br />
                [Chorus] <br />
                I don't care 'bout you, fuck you <br />

              <p>
                [Verse 2] <br />
                I've seen Hollywood Boulevard, welfare hotel <br />
                And I spent the night in jail at the Wilcox Hotel <br />
                <br />

                [Chorus] <br />
                I don't care 'bout you, fuck you <br />

                [Verse 3] <br />
                I've seen an old man have a heart attack in Manhattan <br />
                Well, he died while we just stood there looking at him <br />
                Ain't he cute? <br />
                <br />

                [Verse 4] <br>
                I seen men rolling drunks, I seen bodies in the streets <br>
                I saw a man who was sleeping in his own puke <br>
                And a man with no legs crawling down <br>
                Fifth Street trying just to get something to eat <br><br>
                [Chorus] <br>
                I don't care 'bout you, fuck you <br>

                                <p>
                                    Well, it's late at night, and I'm all alone
                                    And I can hear her boots as she's near her home
                                    Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
                                    Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
                                    Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door
                                    Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore
                                    Crack, crack I'm feeling so sore
                                    I never should asked for black leather
                                    Black leather
                                    Ooh, black leather
                                    Ow black leather
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And you can try to hide, but you won't get far
                                    You can let her in, and you'll start it again
                                    Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
                                    Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
                                    Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door
                                    Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore
                                    Crack, crack I'm feeling so sore
                                    I never should asked for black leather
                                    Black leather
                                    Ooh, black leather
                                    Ow black leather
                                    Ooh
                                    Ooh

          <p>It doesn't pay to try
          All the smart boys know why
          It doesn't mean, I didn't try
          I just never know, why</p>

          <p>It isn't 'cause I'm all alone
          Oh, baby, you're not home
          And when I'm home
          Big deal, I'm still alone</p>

          <p>It's so restless, I am
          Beat my head against a pole
          Try to knock some sense, down 'side my bones
          And even though it don't show
          Those guys are so old</p>

          <p>Can't put your arms around a memory
          Can't put your arms around a memory
          Can't put your arms around a memory
          Don't try
          Don't try</p>

          <p>You're just a basket case
          And you got no name
          Could you live with me?
          Go on and say
          And even though it don't show
          Those guys are so old</p>

          <p>Can't put your arms around a memory
          Can't put your arms around a memory
          Can't put your arms around a memory
          Can't put your arms around a memory
          Don't try
          Don't try</p>

          <p>Johnny you're me
          Yeah, you're memory
          I want to put my arms around your memory
          I can't try, I can't try...don't try</p>

          <p>All I need is some inspiration
            Before I do somebody some harm
            I feel just like a vegetable
            Down here on the farm</p>

          <p>Nobody comes to see me
            Nobody here to turn me on
            I ain't even got a lover
            Down here on the farm</p>

          <p>They told me to get healthy
            They told me to get some sun
            But boredom eats me like ketchup
            Down here on the farm</p>

          <p>Drinking lemonade shanty
            Ain't no body gonna do me harm
            But I'm like a fish out of water
            Down here on the farm</p>

          <p>I write a thousand letters
            'Til my fingers all gone numb
            But I never see no postman
            Down here on the farm</p>

          <p>I call my baby on the telephone
            I say come down and have some fun
            But she knows what the score is
            Down here on the farm</p>
            
            <p>I can't fall in love with a wheat field
            I can't fall in love with a barn
            When everything smells like horse shit
            Down here on the farm</p>

            <p>Blue skies and swimming pools
            Add so much charm
            But I'd rather be back in Soho
            Than down here on the farm</p>

            <p>On the fucking farm!</p>

            <p>Are you born in a fucking barn or what?</p>
